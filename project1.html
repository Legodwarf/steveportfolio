                        A Rigorous project analyzing a new product launch for a fictional vacuum manufacturer.
                        Analyses include financial projections (NPV, Ecpected Cost) and a Balanced Scorecard incorporating quantitative and qualitative data.

                    <p>
                        This project was the capstone project for an introductory Data Analytics course. 
                        It was a rigorous project that combined all of the skills I had learned in the course.
                        Based on responses from company executives metrics for a successful PM were identified.
                        SQL was used to extract necessary data from a SQL Server database.
                        A python script was written to automate future data extraction processes.
                        Using Excel and the extracted data, a Balanced Scorecard was created to rank PM candidates and predict the best product to launch.

                    <p>
                        One potential product manager was identified as the best candidate for the job.
                        The Balanced Scorecard was used to rank the other candidates 
                        Based on the financial projections, the best product to launch was determined.

                        All methods and findings were documented in a 7 page report.

                    <p>
                        This priject was a turning point in my education.
                        Prior to this, I was unsure of what major to pursue.
                        This project showed me that data analytics is just solving puzzles with data as the pieces.
                        I immediately contacted my academic advisor and changed majors to Data Analytics.
